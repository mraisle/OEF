That’s exactly what researchers on the other side of the world recently accomplished.

                    Long a favorite of horticulturalists and Hollywood, the Venus&#x27; flytrap has mesmerized people ever since it was discovered in the bogs of Southeastern North Carolina chomping down insects. But has anyone ever tried communicating with the pop-culture icon that only grows naturally within 75 miles of Wilmington (and Seymour talking to Audrey II in “Little Shop of Horrors” doesn’t count)? That’s exactly what researchers on the other side of the world recently accomplished.

But has anyone ever tried communicating with the pop-culture icon that only grows naturally within 75 miles of Wilmington (and Seymour talking to Audrey II in “Little Shop of Horrors” doesn’t count)? That’s exactly what researchers on the other side of the world recently accomplished.

                    Long a favorite of horticulturalists and Hollywood, the Venus&#x27; flytrap has mesmerized people ever since it was discovered in the bogs of Southeastern North Carolina chomping down insects. But has anyone ever tried communicating with the pop-culture icon that only grows naturally within 75 miles of Wilmington (and Seymour talking to Audrey II in “Little Shop of Horrors” doesn’t count)? That’s exactly what researchers on the other side of the world recently accomplished.

                    Long a favorite of horticulturalists and Hollywood, the Venus&#x27; flytrap has mesmerized people ever since it was discovered in the bogs of Southeastern North Carolina chomping down insects. But has anyone ever tried communicating with the pop-culture icon that only grows naturally within 75 miles of Wilmington (and Seymour talking to Audrey II in “Little Shop of Horrors” doesn’t count)? That’s exactly what researchers on the other side of the world recently accomplished.

Does that mean Breeze Airways will soon be touching down in North Carolina?
