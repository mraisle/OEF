                    At more than 4,000 square feet, the Clemmons house Andrew and Holly Miller moved into about a year-and-a-half ago is bigger than most. But Andrew Miller, half of the partnership in the Two Bald Brothers home construction company, says he went to great lengths to make sure the couple wasn&#x27;t swapping sustainability for size when it came time to build their own house. &quot;We&#x27;re kind of into green living,&quot; Miller said.

                    Duke Energy and a Texas-based subsidiary of an international energy company were the top bidders Wednesday for wind energy rights in a pair of areas totaling 110,000 acres off the coast of North Carolina. Combined, the two bids are worth $315 million, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced Wednesday evening after an all-day auction. Sixteen potential bidders were approved to take part in the sale. The opening bids at 9 a.m. were less than $3 million.

                    Duke Energy and a Texas-based subsidiary of an international energy company were the top bidders Wednesday for wind energy rights in a pair of areas totaling 110,000 acres off the coast of North Carolina. Combined, the two bids are worth $315 million, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced Wednesday evening after an all-day auction. Sixteen potential bidders were approved to take part in the sale. The opening bids at 9 a.m. were less than $3 million.

                    In April 2021, Duke Energy and Wells Fargo announced an agreement that would allow the financial services company to buy all of the power generated at a 58-megawatt, 600-acre solar farm planned in Catawba County. Wells Fargo said at the time that the project would supply more than half the electricity for its 7.5 million square feet of facilities - supporting 36,000 employees - within the Duke Energy Carolinas service area.

                    One of North Carolina&#x27;s largest owners and operators of renewable energy facilities is seeking state approval to develop a $104 million solar farm on nearly 500 acres in Davidson County. The development, straddling N.C. 109 just south of the Denton town limits, would have a power capacity of nearly 80 megawatts and produce more than 179,000 megawatt-hours per year using 189,000 solar panels, according to an application filed with the N.C. Utilities Commission.

                    Duke Energy increased its capacity to produce renewable energy by 20% in 2021, but wind and solar accounted for a slightly lower percentage of its actual power generation compared to 2020, the company announced Tuesday. As Duke continued to retire coal-burning operations, nuclear power (35%) remained only slightly behind natural gas (36%) in the company&#x27;s mix of electricity generation last year, according to the company&#x27;s annual update on environmental, social and governance issues.

                    North Carolina is set to receive nearly $171 million in federal funding over five years for projects aimed at reducing vehicle emissions in the state. The money represents the state&#x27;s portion of $6.4 billion from the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Carbon Reduction Program. It&#x27;s part of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Investment Act approved by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden in November 2021.

                    The T-shirt has become a medium of choice for Americans looking to proclaim their commitment to just about any conceivable cause. Earth Day has been one of them since its inception in 1970. But more than a half-century later, in an America already affected by climate change, obsessed with sustainability and conscious of carbon footprints, what does that new &quot;Save the Planet!&quot; T-shirt really say about our devotion to protecting the Earth?
